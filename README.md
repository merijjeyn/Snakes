# Snakes
A Simulation of the classic game of snake with a twist
The simulation starts with only one snake. Every snake has only one goal: Getting food. And they move accordingly.
After reaching a particular height, the snake divides into two smaller snakes. 
Snakes try to avoid getting stuck in some manner but sometimes two snakes collide in such a way that they get stuck. 
The simulation stops when there are no more places in the world or when every snake gets stuck
